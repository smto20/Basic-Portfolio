  <h1>My name is <span>S. Marie</span> & I design web pages and apps. I love creating that perfect piece to complement a client's brand.</h1>
  Based out of Charlotte, NC

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am passionate about programming and digital applications. I also spend lots of time working on extra projects in my free time to keep up with web trends and to contribute to things I love (especially if it involves animals)!</p>
  <p>I have had the opportunity to work with companies both small and large - ranging from start-ups to companies with thousands of clients and data points in the millions. </p>
  <p>I love to challenge myself with new and out of the box projects and have worked with developers all over the globe.</p>
  <p>I am a full stack developer which means I can take your project from the initial concept all the way to the completed application. I have experience in front end and back end programming and have worked with many languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more.</p>
  <p>When I'm not coding, I love to create art and sell it online at:<a href="#" target="_blank">SMarieArts.com</a></p>
  <p>If you are looking for a designer and/or developer <a href="contact.html">get in touch!</a>I would love to see how I can help you or your business.</p>
